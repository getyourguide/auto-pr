# Contributing

When contributing to this repository, we encourage to first discuss the change you wish to make via issue before submitting a change. We're not strict about this and for small changes feel free to pull request directly.

-   Aim to keep pull requests scoped to one feature to ease review
-   Add tests to verify that the changes works (if possible)
-   Include or update documentation for new or changed features
